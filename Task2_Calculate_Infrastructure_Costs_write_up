Total: $5671.01
Explain:
- EC2: downgrade EC2 instances from c5.xlarge Compute Optimized to m5.large general purpose. Actually we can keep c5.xlarge here since it is only $300 different.
- RDS writer: downgrade from db.r5.12xlarge to db.r5.8xlarge to reduce the cost. It has less CPU and memory but network performance is the same
- RDS reader: downgrade from db.r5.12xlarge to db.r5.4xlarge. Reader can be a bit less powerful since reader only handles reading data


Increased_Cost Estimate: https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=cea9951c73bd088243bdc94c21ae6176a3a87928
Total: $19059.13
Explain:
- EC2: upgrade instance type to c5.18xlarge for more CPU, more memory, and better network performance
- RDS writer: upgrade the writer instance to db.r5.16xlarge for more CPU, more memory, and better network performance
