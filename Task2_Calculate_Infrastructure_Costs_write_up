Explain:
- EC2: downgrade EC2 instances from c5.xlarge Compute Optimized to m5.large general purpose. Actually we can keep c5.xlarge here since it is only $300 different.
- RDS writer: keep db.r5.12xlarge
- RDS reader: downgrade from db.r5.12xlarge to db.r5.4xlarge. Reader can be a bit less powerful since reader only handles reading data

Total: $19630.29
Explain:
- EC2: upgrade instance type to c5.9xlarge for more CPU, more memory, and better network performance
- RDS writer: upgrade the writer instance to db.r5.24xlarge for more CPU, more memory, and better network performance
