# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Move RecipeWebServiceInstance to a private subnet to disallow public access.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No. As we know, API keys can be stolen to ssh to the Attack Instance inside VPC.
VPC endpoints only allow us to block requests that do not originate from VPC network, but the Attack Instance is already in the VPC network.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. Only apply for future uploads.

# The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
Since we make changes to the stack resources outside of AWS CloudFromation, it can create a mismatch between the stack template and the current state of the stack resource,
which can cause errors when update or delete the stack.
