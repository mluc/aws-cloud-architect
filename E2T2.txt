Provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities:

AWS config:
- Rule: securityhub-alb-http-to-https-redirection-check-0cca8a40.
c1-web-service-alb should configure HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- Rule: securityhub-ec2-instance-managed-by-ssm-946a4a38
Web Service Instance and Web Service Instance should have AWS Systems Manager enable


AWS Inspector:
- Change WebAppSG inbound rules so that Web Service Instance can not be reached from the internet.

AWS Security Hub:
- Avoid using root account
- Use MFA
