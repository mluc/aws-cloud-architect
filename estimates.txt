- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
It depends on how often we store a new backup. If we store a new backup every 6 hours, we have an RPO of 6 hours.
We can shorten the backup period but it depends on how long it takes for a backup too.

It can be 0 minute if it is setup as multi-region (Ex: DynamoDB), it will use the DynamoDB instance from other regions if this one failed.
It it is not setup as multi-region, it depends on how often we store a new backup. If we store a new backup every 6 hours, we have an RPO of 6 hours.
